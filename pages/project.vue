                <p class="is-size-5 text-weight-normal text-grey-light">Over the years, the web app went through
                    several redesigns that had not been fully implemented and the source code to the native mobile apps
                    had been lost. The Engineering team recommended building a Progressive Web App (PWA) to replace the
                    mobile apps, leverage the team's expertise, and have a shared codebase for both mobile platforms.
                    This would also allow us to refactor the web application at the feature level without negatively
                    impacting the experience for clients.</p>
